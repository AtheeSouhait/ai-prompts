- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for all component styling to maintain consistency. Avoid writing custom CSS unless necessary for a special case that Tailwind cannot cover (utility-first approach keeps styles uniform and themable)
- Organize Tailwind classes in your markup logically and readably. For example, list display and positioning utilities first, then spacing/margins/padding, followed by color and typography classes.
- Utilize Tailwind's responsive design utilities (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.) and state variants (like hover:, focus:, dark:) instead of writing custom media queries or inline JS for state-based styling. This ensures responsiveness and interactivity styles stay in the markup and are easier to maintain  
- Take advantage of new Tailwind v4 features. For instance, use container queries (`@container` rules and corresponding utility classes) to create truly responsive components based on container size, and leverage CSS variables in Tailwind for dynamic theming if your design requires it  
- Keep the `tailwind.config.ts` updated and aligned with your design system. Define your project's color palette, spacing scale, fonts, and other theme customizations there so that you use consistent design tokens throughout. Ensure the `content` paths in the config include all relevant file patterns (e.g., your .tsx files in src/components) so Tailwind can purge unused styles in production builds  
- Use the `@apply` directive sparingly for extracting repetitive utility combinations in your CSS, but prefer making React components or using composition for reusability. Avoid too much custom CSS â€“ lean on Tailwind's utilities and component structure for code reuse  
- When possible, choose Tailwind classes over inline styles or separate CSS files for UI components to maintain a consistent design language across the game interface
